HiðŸ‘‹, this is the GitHub profile of the QUANTUM EU project. 

Visit ðŸ‘€ [QUANTUM - The health data quality label website](https://quantumproject.eu/) for more information on the project. 

This GitHub profile will contain the repositories managing the developments towards a data quality and utility label for the European Health Data Space ([EDHS](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52022PC0197)).
It will include the foundational structure and concepts of the QUANTUM label, and the self-assessment tools to annotate the datasets with it. 

The purpose of the `QUANTUM label` is to create a common labelling system to informe the quality and utility of datasets for scientific and health innovation purposes within the [healthData@EU](https://acceptance.data.health.europa.eu/home) ecosystem and ensure interoperability with other EU data spaces.
